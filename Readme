# Ca-MIL Demo

This repository provides a **simple demo** that shows how to use the `Ca-MIL` model.
It includes a minimal end to end example that demonstrates:

- Generating synthetic brain network data
- Extracting FC based features using Ca-MIL
- Performing instance level clustering with KMeans
- Bag level classification using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)
- A clean and modular project structure suitable for future extensions

This demo is intended only as a **basic usage example**, and can be easily adapted to real datasets.

## Project Structure

your_project/
main.py             Entry point
config.py           Hyperparameter configuration
dataset.py          Synthetic dataset and dataloader generation
feature.py          Feature extraction and KMeans clustering
train.py            Training loop
test.py             Testing pipeline
utils.py            Utility functions
model.py            Ca-MIL model implementation


## How to Run

python main.py


## Notes

1. This is a **minimal demo** using *random synthetic data*.
   Replace the dataset generation in `dataset.py` with your real data loader when needed.

2. Expected input shape for real data:
```

[batch_size, num_windows, ROI_num, timepoints]

3. The core model is implemented in `model.py`.

4. Feature extraction and clustering steps are organized in `feature.py`.
